This project focuses on developing a threat detection system utilizing Python and machine learning techniques. I used NSL-KDD dataset for both training and testing, aiming to accurately identify potential security threats in network traffic.
# Key Features:
    Data Processing: Utilizes NSL-KDD train and test datasets to prepare data for model training and evaluation.
    Model Training: Employs Jupyter and Anaconda for a streamlined data science workflow, enabling effective model training and experimentation.
    Prediction and Response: Implements a predictive model that can detect various types of attacks, automatically triggering responses based on the identified threat.
    Technologies Used: Python, machine learning libraries, NSL-KDD dataset, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda.
